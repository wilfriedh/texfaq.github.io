As yet, there is no book "Programming in LaTeX3", and even if
such a thing existed there would be lots of gaps.  So there is no
_comprehensive_ support.

However, there are some 'resources':
  

-  The "introduction to LaTeX3 ideas" in the [`expl3`](https://ctan.org/pkg/expl3)
    documentation gives a broad-brush overview of the concepts.
-  Joseph Wright has written a short series of 
    [blog posts](https://www.texdev.net/2014/02/02/programming-latex3-a-summary-so-far/),
    which may help.
-  There is also a complete command reference in the
    [`interface3`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel) document.

The documents are still subject to development; some of the broader
design issues are discussed on the LaTeX mailing list
`latex-l`&nbsp;&mdash; you may subscribe to that list by sending a
message by sending a message
  `subscribe latex-l <_your name_>`
to <a href="mailto:listserv@urz.Uni-Heidelberg.de">listserv@urz.Uni-Heidelberg.de</a>
